    "\n",
    "Constraint satisfaction problems are traditionally solved using **backtracking**. Backtracking is an optimization on depth-first search used specifically for the problem of constraint satisfaction, with improvements coming from two main principles:\n",
    "1. **Fix an ordering for variables**, and select values for variables in this order. Because assignments are commutative (e.g. assigning $WA = Red, NT = Green$ is identical to $NT = Green, WA = Red$)\n",
    "2. When selecting values for a variable, **only select values that don’t conflict with any previously assigned values**. If no such values exist, backtrack and return to the previous variable, changing its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most used techniques are variants of:\n",
    "* Backtracking (Depth-First Search)\n",
    "* Constraint Propagation\n",
    "   * Forward checking\n",
    "   * Arc consistency (ac3 algorithm) - for more watch this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cCS8rrYT14)\n",
    "* Local Search\n",
    "   * minConflict (Hill Climbing)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)*** - When selecting which variable to assign next, using an MRV policy chooses whichever unassigned variable has the fewest valid remaining values (the most constrained variable). This is intuitive in the sense that the most constrained variable is most likely to run out of possible values and result in backtracking if left unassigned, and so it’s best to assign a value to it sooner than later.\n",
    "* ***Least Constraining Value (LCV)*** - Similarly, when selecting which value to assign next, a good policy to implement is to select the value that prunes the fewest values from the domains of the remaining unassigned values. Notably, this requires additional computation (e.g. rerunning arc consistency/forward checking or other filtering methods for each value to find the LCV), but can still yield speed gains depending on usage.\n",
